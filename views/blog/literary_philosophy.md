Art, intellectually, is at best a degenerate form of theory. The most interesting parts of art can be said in a line of two in a straight inquiry. Art does not compare to theory's ability to discuss the world, and one of the largest faults of our civilizaiton is that there is a confusion between intellectualism and art.

But art is not useless. 

Art is the artificial manipulation of the subconscious by a method of communication.  

This means first that art is present in the communication of theory. It's present in the typography of a book, the graphic design, and the clarity of its wording. In an audiobook, art is present in the recitation, the voice, the prosody. 

It means that secondly, art is necessary for the anecodotal illumination of a person's life. It's easy to dismiss a person's life w it's only a sentence, but only a proper book or film can make you feel the power of their existence. 

The ability to communicate theory is built on the understanding of an art, which comes from its study.

But as a consequence, it means art is a slave to a greater purpose.

People consume art in this context. The genre is a direct consequence of this, where certain genres are generally tailored to give a specific theme of experience (horror, terror; fantasy, splendor; romance, love; mystery, curiosity). 

But music, painting, graphic design; don't rely on genres as much, and this develops our first dimension of art. Sensual vs. narrative. That is, how informational a piece of art is.

Symbolism's place in this is immense, as sensual art, like illustraiton, and music, often relies heavily on symbolism to be narrative.
