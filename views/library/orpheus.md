## Orpheus

The legendary Orpheus was said to have written sacred poetry, however much of the poetry that we have now attributed to him was of a much later date, like the Argonautica and the Hymns. There are fragments from Classical times attributed to Orpheus. Because Orpheus is so important, I collected what I could find of those here.

### Fragments

	
#### Plato - Cratylus 402b-c
Ωκεανὸς πρῶτος καλλίρροος ἦρχε γάμοιο, ὅς ῤα κασιωνήτην ὁμομήτορα Τηθὺν ὄπυιεν.
		
*Fair-flowing Ocean was the first to marry and he wedded his sister Tethys, daughter of his mother.*

#### Plato - Philebus 66c
ἕκτῃ δ' ἐν γενεᾷ καταπαύσατε κόσμον ἀοιδῆς
	
*but with the sixth generation cease the rhythmic song*

#### Plato - The Laws 669d 
λαχεῖν ὥραν τῆς τέρψιος.

*...have attained the full flower of joyousness.*

#### Aristotle Econom. Book 3 

(Only the latin version is available for book 3, so I'm just translating it into English)

*Holy health of soul, and wealth, the child of a brave spirit, companion him no more.*
