### Introduction

This was made as I found it difficult to have a cohesive collection of Greek poetry online, which I wished to use for personal study. I'll be making pdfs to study. I'll add them as I come across them.

I'm not a scholar by any measure and I'm creating this for my own posterity. Translations if found are public domain, and sometimes modified to make them to be a bit more accurate based on my limited greek.

I will also sometimes add their biographies with a focus on legend if it's artistically significant, like with Ibycus' cranes.

1. *Italics* means either nothing survived, or almost nothing (sentential fragments)
3. **Bold** means at least one of their works of substantial form has survived
