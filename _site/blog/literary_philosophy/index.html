		<main><p>Art, intellectually, is at best a degenerate form of theory. The most interesting parts of art can be said in a line of two in a straight inquiry. Art does not compare to theory's ability to discuss the world, and one of the largest faults of our civilizaiton is that there is a confusion between intellectualism and art.</p>
<p>But art is not useless.</p>
<p>Art is the artificial manipulation of the subconscious by a method of communication.</p>
<p>This means first that art is present in the communication of theory. It's present in the typography of a book, the graphic design, and the clarity of its wording. In an audiobook, art is present in the recitation, the voice, the prosody.</p>
<p>It means that secondly, art is necessary for the anecodotal illumination of a person's life. It's easy to dismiss a person's life w it's only a sentence, but only a proper book or film can make you feel the power of their existence.</p>
<p>The ability to communicate theory is built on the understanding of an art, which comes from its study.</p>
<p>But as a consequence, it means art is a slave to a greater purpose.</p>
<p>People consume art in this context. The genre is a direct consequence of this, where certain genres are generally tailored to give a specific theme of experience (horror, terror; fantasy, splendor; romance, love; mystery, curiosity).</p>
<p>But music, painting, graphic design; don't rely on genres as much, and this develops our first dimension of art. Sensual vs. narrative. That is, how informational a piece of art is.</p>
<p>Symbolism's place in this is immense, as sensual art, like illustraiton, and music, often relies heavily on symbolism to be narrative.</p>
