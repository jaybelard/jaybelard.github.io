<p>I never knew what poetry was supposed to be for, and there were moments where I flirted with poetry but more often than not I disliked it. It was nothing more than to make my prose pretty, but I realized quickly that poetry's place was in the social sphere.</p>
<p>Poetry is meant to be said to others (not read). I imagined I would've got it with how much poetry is recited, but poetry isn't recited normally but by thespians.</p>
<p>It should be done as a tool of social worth, and only when the moment arises. We already recite poetry nowadays when we quote songs, but otherwise it's very limited to music, and not what it once was.</p>
<p>That's why people memorized poems. They were never meant to be read, but used, like limericks and stuff.</p>
<p>I realized it actually when in every play, they quote it. It meant it was popularly recited, or requoted.</p>
